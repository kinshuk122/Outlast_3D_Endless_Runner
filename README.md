# Outlast_3D_Endless_Runner

In Outlast, players must use quick reflexes and precise controls to navigate a rolling ball through a series of challenging obstacles like spikes, drums, cement blocks, etc. Additionally, players will encounter debuffs, which are negative effects that hinder their progress, and power-ups, which provide temporary boosts to help them overcome obstacles and continue their journey.
